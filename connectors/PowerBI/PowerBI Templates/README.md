# PoC Dashboards for EAS : 

1) The implementation is far from polished, but it works. Treat it as a PoC level of development - I'd welcome any improvement contributions.
2) Requires connector found elsewhere in this repo.
3) Upon first Run you'll be required to enter your EAS Repository-ID and tenantID as Parameters which will be used in the data connections queries
4) You'll be prompted multiple times for 'Anonymous' Authentication - Click OK for each (1 per query)

# Troubleshooting

1) If PowerBI states incorrect credentials, double check both the credentials and the RepositoryID - as either may generate this error.
